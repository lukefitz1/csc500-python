In the main section of your code, implement the print_menu() function. print_menu() has a ShoppingCart parameter and outputs a menu of options to manipulate the shopping cart. Each option is represented by a single character. Build and output the menu within the function.

If an invalid character is entered, continue to prompt for a valid choice. Hint: Implement Quit before implementing other options. Call print_menu() in the main() function. Continue to execute the menu until the user enters q to Quit.
Example:
MENU
a - Add item to cart
r - Remove item from cart
c - Change item quantity
i - Output items' descriptions
o - Output shopping cart
q - Quit
